Privacy Policy

<h3><b>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h3>
</p>
<p>Gust, Inc. respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This privacy policy applies to gust.com, equity.gust.com, and launch.gust.com (‘Gust Platform’) owned and operated by Gust, Inc., and/or it's affiliated entities including Preferred Return, Inc. and Sharewave, Inc. (collectively, ‘Gust’, "We", "Us" or "Our").  This Privacy Policy describes Gusts’ policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data when you use the Gust Platform. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal data. We will not use or share your confidential information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect from other sources. Information which you do not designate as confidential may be publicly available and disclosed. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in Gusts’ Terms of Service . </p>
<p>

</p>
<h3><b>The Gust Platform</h3>
</p>
<p>The Gust Platform offers a set of tools for investors and for entrepreneurs on which they may do many things, including exchange information. Gust also allows access to the Gust Platform to Organizations for use by their members.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<h3><b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b></h3>
<p>
The GDPR is an EU Regulation to improve the protection of the personal data of EU citizens and increase the obligations of organisations who collect or process personal data. These new regulations take effect on the 25th of May 2018. The regulations greatly enhance the data privacy and security of our customers and extend to them exercisable rights enabling greater control over one's personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
The full specification of the GDPR rights and regulations can be found here</a>
</p>
<p>
Gust functions as both a controller and processor of our customers' personally identifiable information (PII). Additionally, we employ a number of sub-processors to which we transmit data for storage or processing beyond feature sets under our immediate control.
</p>
<p>
As a controller of data, we store PII such as customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, IP addresses, phone numbers and avatars. We use databases through GDPR compliant service providers (AWS, Heroku, mLab) to store sensitive customer data.
</p>
<p>
Gust is also a processor of customer data. We use customer data to compile legal documents, surface content, and facilitate investment-related matchmaking services. Sub-processors are leveraged by Gust systems for purposes of financial transaction execution, internal analytics, and system monitoring.
</p>
<p>
We have a system-wide GDPR compliance effort underway which will manifest itself on the core Gust platform as well as any of our hubs, satellite applications, or other owned properties.
</p>
<p>
For more information, please see our GDPR documentation</a>
